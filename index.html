    <h1><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}" style="color:black;">Kurdish Folkloric Lyrics Corpus</a></h1>
    <p class="lead">A collection of oral narratives and songs of generations...</p>
    <p align="justify">
    	Kurdish poetry and prose narratives were historically transmitted orally and less in a written form. Being an essential medium of oral narration and literature, Kurdish lyrics have had a unique attribute in becoming a vital resource for different types of studies, including <b>Digital Humanities</b>, <b>Computational Folkloristics</b> and <b>Computational Linguistics</b>. As an initial study of its kind for the Kurdish language, this paper presents our efforts in transcribing and collecting Kurdish folk lyrics as a corpus that covers various Kurdish musical genres, in particular <i>Beyt</i>, <i>Goran√Æ</i>, <i>Bend</i>, and <i>Heyran</i>. We believe that this corpus contributes to Kurdish language processing in several ways, such as compensation for the lack of a long history of written text by incorporating oral literature, presenting an unexplored realm in Kurdish language processing, and assisting the initiation of Kurdish computational folkloristics. Our corpus contains 49,582 tokens in the Sorani dialect of Kurdish.

    	This corpus is the result of the manual transcription of audiovisual material. You can read more about this project in <a href="https://sinaahmadi.github.io/docs/articles/ahmadi2020folklyrics.pdf" target="_blank">our paper</a>. It is being constantly completed. Everybody can contribute to enrich the corpus by:
		<ul>
			<li>Adding more <b>folkloric</b> lyrics in other dialects, namely Kurmanji, Southern Kurdish and Gorani languages</li>
			<li>Translating the lyrics into other languages, particularly English</li>
			<li>Reporting errors or mistranscriptions</li>
		</ul>
